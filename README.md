## Write You a Haskell for Great Good

In the style of [Write Yourself A Scheme][wyas] I'd like to build
something similar but for Haskell. This would not be aimed at
beginners but rather people who already know Haskell but might not be
sure how to implement it.

See `design.md` for an overview how this is all going to go. Stay
tuned for actual code.
